    "You have a new startup business that aims to disrupt the pizza world by selling square pizzas.  You want your pizzas to have the same total area as the boring round pizzas your competitors sell, so you decide to write a program to help you calculate the size of a square pizza that will match the size of a round pizza with a given radius.  The idea is you can measure the radius of a competitor's pizza, plug that into your program, and get the width and height your square pizza should be to match it.\n",

    "Now the code is more reusable, but that one function is doing a few very different things.  Usually, it is best for a function to do one thing, because then it can be reused in even more situations.  For example, maybe sometimes you will get pizza radii from your automatic web crawler software that finds pizza radii on competitor's websites.  In that case, you wouldn't want to ask the program's user to type in a radius, but you still want to use the calculation part of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you want to split the function in Part 2 into two functions: one, `input_radius()`, that asks the user to input a radius, and the other, `calc_side()`, calculates and prints the result for a given radius.  You could then reuse the second function in more situations, like with the web crawler.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now your functions need to pass information into and out of themselves.  The `input_radius()` function needs to *return* the value the user entered, and `calc_side()` needs to take a radius as an argument.\n",
