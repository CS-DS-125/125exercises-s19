    "To practice defining classes and to prepare for the upcoming assignment, this exercise will have you create a class to do prediction *very badly*.  The later assignment will involve creating a class for performing [simple linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_linear_regression), a *good* method for basic modeling and prediction, but we can get there in due time.\n",

    "Overall, the goal here is to create a class will let us create an object that, when given a dataframe and two column labels, can make predictions (possibly bad ones, in this case).  Each prediction will be a possible value for the second column given a value for the first column.  For ease and consistency of reference, we will call these columns ``X`` and ``Y``, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we had data on a group of people's heights (in inches) and weights (in pounds), then we might give our predictor that data, set ``X`` to the height column and `Y` to the weight column, and then ask it to make a prediction for a person's weight if their height is 72 [inches, which is 6 feet tall].  It might return a prediction like 190 [pounds].  Or, because this particular exercise will produce a rather poor predictor, it might return a prediction like 10 or 50000000.  Who knows?  The point here is more about working with classes than making good predictions..."

It should use those values to create a set of predictions for all integer values in that range and plot them in a scatterplot.  For example, if the start value is 0 and the end value is 100, it should make predictions for X = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... up to 100, and it should plot each of those predictions with the X value on the x-axis and the predicted value on the Y-axis.\n",

    " * You can make a list containing the integers from the start to the end value either using the `range()` function or by counting in a `for` loop and appending to a growing list.\n",
    " * You can make a list of the predicted values by calling `self.predict()` repeatedly in a for loop and appending the return values to a growing list.\n",
