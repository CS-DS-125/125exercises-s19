We haven't paid attention to the datatypes of the columns in our datasets so far because the data was clean. When we start working with real-world data it will be important to check that the datatypes are what you are expecting. For example, if a column should be a float or an integer but its listed as an object, it's likely that you have strings characters in your dataset mixed in with your numerics. "
