    "# String Manipulations: Names to Emails\n",
    "\n",
    "IWU usernames and email addresses are created from student, faculty, and staff names following a specific pattern.  The username is the first letter of the first name plus up to seven letters of the last name.  It's safe to assume there is a program somewhere generating these automatically, and this exercise sets out to replicate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals:\n",
    " * Practice string manipulations using string operators and string methods (see [Section 5.1](https://snakebear.science/05-StringsListsAndFiles/Strings.html))\n",
    " * Further practice defining and using functions (see [Section 4.3](https://snakebear.science/04-Functions/FunctionDefinitions.html))"

    "But what if we only have someone's full name as a single string, or what if we don't want to bother the user *twice* to ask for each part of their name separately?  That will take a bit more work.  And the email address is usually written in lowercase, so let's do that, too.\n",

    "\n",
    "`split()` will give you back a list of the separate words in a string.  *[While working on this, I'd suggest printing out whatever you get from `split()` so you have something concrete to think about.]*  With any list, you can use indexing on it just like you can on a string.
