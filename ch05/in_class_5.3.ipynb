    "# Exploring Data from 311 Service Calls in Chicago\n",
    "\n",
    "*[Repeated from last time: On the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/), the city of Chicago provides a wealth of data about the city and its governance.  One of the many datasets available catalogs 311 service calls (311 is a telephone number through which the city provides non-emergency services), and of the many collections of data within that broader set, we can find a list of [service requests regarding abandoned vehicles](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Service-Requests/311-Service-Requests-Abandoned-Vehicles-No-Duplica/atid-bgws) collected since 2011.]*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will work through guided steps to further explore and analyze the 311 data.  Much of this will be similar to work done in the previous class (you can see it in `in_class_5.2_worked.ipynb`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Look for `#TODO` comments in cells for places where you should write code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is structured so that you will create variables with partially-processed data and use those variables in later cells to do further analysis.  Remember: once you create a variable in one cell, it can be used in any other cell."

If you want to go further, a next step might be to modify `get_days()` to take an additional parameter and return `None` for any lines that *don't* contain that parameter.  Then you could call, for example, `get_days(line, 'Chevrolet')` and get back numbers for only the Chevrolets (or any other make you specify).  After that modification, you can re-run the rest of the analysis, putting a different make into the argument for `get_days()` each time, to look for differences in how long different makes of cars were reported abandoned.
